Targeted Population: SUNY Korea students

Problem to solve: The problem to solve is to improve the tutoring system. The tutoring system has been active for years in SUNY Korea. However the main issue is that people do not use the tutoring system often. We believe that the main issue was that accessing the tutoring system was not that well presented. Currently, in order to apply for a tutor, all the information you have is a pdf file sent from the school via email. Not only this is very poorly presented, but it is also easy to forget the fact that there is even a tutor center in the first place. So we wish to create a website that provides enough information to encourage students to use the tutoring system.

Proposed Solutions:
 
      * Provide important information about tutors.
         - Tutees shall be provided with plenty of information about tutors so that they can have easy time choosing tutors.
      
      * Deliver tutees' demands and expectations.
          - Tutees shall keep their list of expectations and wants from tutors.

      * Suggest suitable study areas.
          - Both tutees and tutors may choose their favorite spots for the tutoring sessions.   
          
      * Create an interactive environment.
          - Tutees and tutors shall be asked to play a simple game to help them know eachother better.


Data gathering tools: Since our group set to target users as SUNY Korea students, we are going to collect data by surveying them. Like other universities, there are several group chat rooms for several topics in every college in the IGC community. In the case of SUNY, there are Kakaotalk chat rooms by major, class, and club. Among these topics, we are going to utilize group chat rooms made for courses. Kakao Talk has several functions for a survey. We can create a questionnaire, and when the user responds, we receive a report of the results that compiled at the end.Furthermore, when they respond that they need tutoring, we will ask why they think so. We will also investigate what they do when they learn about a class from others without tutoring and its limitation.
